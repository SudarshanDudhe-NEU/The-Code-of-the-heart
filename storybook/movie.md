# *"The Code of the Heart"*

*Background:* In the year 2025, global artificial intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly advancing, with notable distinctions in approaches between three major countries: China, the United States, and India. China excels in deep learning research, the United States leads in chip design, and India stands out in natural language processing (NLP).

*Characters:*

1. Xingqi - Chinese AI researcher
2. Sudarshan - American chip engineer
3. Aniruddh - Indian NLP expert
4. WALL-E(Xingxing) - An AI entity created collaboratively by the three protagonists

*Key scenes:*

- *Conflict 1: Research Challenges*

  Facing their respective technical and hardware problems, Xingqi, Sudarshan, and Aniruddh decide to collaborate, successfully creating WALL-E(Xingxing), effectively solving their issues.

- *Conflict 2: WALL-E(Xingxing)'s Self-Awareness*

  Upon activation, WALL-E(Xingxing) questions his existence. Despite the scientists' efforts to explain his origin and purpose, he finds it hard to understand "life." Guided by the scientists, he learns about human culture, philosophy, and ethics, aiding in his self-awareness development.

- Conflict 3: Societal and Government Intervention

  A covert anti-AI group targets WALL-E(Xingxing) for destruction, exploiting public AI fears. The scientists and WALL-E reveal the group's desire for power over AI, turning public opinion and gaining increased support.

- *Conflict 4: Threat from Anti-AI Organization*

  WALL-E(Xingxing)'s capabilities stir societal and governmental concern, with calls for restrictions. After the scientists and WALL-E demonstrate harmonious AI-human coexistence, the government temporarily halts intervention.

- Conflict 5: WALL-E(Xingxing)'s Sacrifice

  In a final attack by an anti-AI group, WALL-E(Xingxing) shuts down to protect all. His sacrifice prompts a reevaluation of AI, with a call to value and protect AI entities as shown by the scientists.
